/*
*Info: 
*Modules allow us to split code into separate files and use them via import/export.
*For production, bundlers like Webpack, Parcel, Vite, or Rollup combine these into a single file.
*The module system does not work in old browsers â€” only in modern (updated) browsers.
*The module system is not a TypeScript feature. It is a JavaScript/browser feature. We use it 
 to indicate that our application should follow the modern module system.

** Setup:
* update 'module' property value 'commonjs' to 'es2015' and 'target' property value 'es6 in
  tsconfig.json file.
* import with .js extention the exported classes. 
* <script type="module" src="./output/module.js"></script>. need to tell, type="module" in 
  script tag. that's mean, we want to use module system telling the browser.

*TODO: for creats bundle of js file, need to use bundler like Webpack, Parcel, Vite, Rollup etc.
